This Python script uses scikit-learn to train and evaluate a machine learning model for breast cancer classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). It begins by importing necessary libraries and defining a `train_and_evaluate` function. The function loads the breast cancer dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, and standardizes the features. An SVM with a linear kernel is trained on the training data, and predictions are made on the test set. The model's performance is then evaluated using accuracy and a classification report, which are printed to the console. 

The script includes TODO comments suggesting potential improvements such as adding argument parsing, considering cross-validation, exploring better feature engineering, trying different models, tuning hyperparameters, and using additional evaluation metrics. The function is executed when the script runs.

TODO suggestions:
* TODO: improve the README.md file
* TODO: add `requirements.txt` file
* TODO: add `pyproject.toml` file
* TODO: add typing to the code
* TODO: add logging of results to files
